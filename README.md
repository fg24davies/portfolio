# Flora Davies' Makers' Portfolio

This portfolio is a record of what I have achieved during the Makers' bootcamp. 
Each week.md includes in more details, the goals I set myself, the process I used to achieve these goals and evidence of achieving these goals. There is also reflection on what went well, what didn't and what I will change for the next week.

Click through to any of the Week.md links for more detail and links to projects.
