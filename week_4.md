### Weekly Goals
#### Goals

1. Build a simple web app with a database :dancer:
2. Follow an effective debugging process for database applications :dancer:
3. Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships between tables) :confused:


#### How will I achieve these goals? (include resources and strategies)

1. By working through the afternoon challenge in my pair programming sessions and then completing the weekend challenge alone
2. To complete the SQL practicals to understand the possible
3. Attending the workshop on Class Responsibility Collaborator cards


#### What is the evidence I have achieved the goals?

1. Built two simple web apps with databases: [Bookmark Manager](https://github.com/fg24davies/bookmark_manager) and [Chitter](https://github.com/fg24davies/chitter-challenge)
2. [SQL Practicals](https://github.com/fg24davies/makers_learning_journey/blob/master/week_4/SQLZoo_Answers.md)
3. [CRC cards](https://github.com/fg24davies/makers_learning_journey/tree/master/week_4/domain_modelling_student_directory_using_crc_cards)

### Daily Goals

#### Monday 22/03/2021

- AIM: To start to build a simple web app and set up my computer with SQL
- PLAN: Afternoon pair programming and read resoures on databases
- EVIDENCE: [Bookmark Manager](https://github.com/fg24davies/bookmark_manager)

#### Tuesday 23/03/2021

- AIM: To learn more about SQL
- PLAN: Domplete SQL practicals
- EVIDENCE: [SQL practicals](https://github.com/fg24davies/makers_learning_journey/blob/master/week_4/SQLZoo_Answers.md)

#### Wednesday 24/03/2021

- AIM: Learn about a database structure and relational databases from domain structure
- PLAN: To attend CRC cards workshop
- EVIDENCE: [CRC cards skills workshop](https://github.com/fg24davies/makers_learning_journey/tree/master/week_4/domain_modelling_student_directory_using_crc_cards)

#### Thursday 25/03/2021

- AIM: To go over a couple week1 and week2 principles (class interaction, dependency injection) to address knowledge gaps
- PLAN: Practicals in 1:1 with a coach
- EVIDENCE: I feel more comfortable with the role of classes. The 1:1 also helped me pinpoint areas of learning that I need to work out and appreciate what I have learnt.

### Weekly Reflection

What went well? 
During this week, we were introduced to SQL and databases. I enjoyed the SQL practicals and the idea of querying the database. I also feel happy to set up a database and testing environment. Chitter Challenge I focussed on the TDD process so I am pleased with this.

What can I improve on?
The relationships between tables within my database.
