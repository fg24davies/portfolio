# Week 2: 08/03/2021

### Weekly Goals
#### Goals

1. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage :dance: 
2. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking :dancer:
3. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change) :confused:
4. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback :dancer:

#### How will I achieve these goals? (include resources and strategies)
1. By completing the afternoon weekly challenge in the pair programming sessions and the weekend challenge
2. Attend the mocking workshop, use the practicals and skills workshops given for mocking in a pair program session
3. Complete the OO Relationships (Forwarding, Polymorphism) practicals 
4. Watch the video explaining what reviews are, attend the process workshop, use the [code review rubric](https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge/blob/master/docs/review.md) for the weekeend code review.

#### What is the evidence I have achieved the goals?

1. [Oyster card weekly challenge]
2. [Mocking practicals] and discussion with pair partner on the Friday about mocking
3. [OO Relationships (Forwarding, Polymorphism) practicals]
4. My first review of my partners weekend challenge

### Daily Goals

Monday 08/03/2021

- AIM: To do a formal review of my pair partner's weekend challenge 
- PLAN: To attend the workshop, read through the [code review guide](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/how-to/code-review.md)
- EVIDENCE: Submitted my review of code to my pair partner and discussed feedback

Tuesday 09/03/2021

- AIM: To learn about mocking and consolidate learning on doubling
- PLAN: Use the Mocking skills workshop and then the mocking practical given in the resources.
- EVIDENCE: Instead, the afternoon challenge [Oystercard] focussed on using mocking and stubs

Wednesday 10/03/2021

- AIM: To learn more about domain modelling and create a process
- PLAN: To attend the workshop
- EVIDENCE: Have taken the template of breaking down user stories in Nouns/Actions to use in my upcoming challenges.

Thursday 11/03/2021

- AIM: To focus on breaking 1 class into 2 classes
- PLAN: Practise this in the afternoon challenge with my pair partner
- EVIDENCE: OysterCard repo

Friday 12/03/2021

- AIM: To learn more practical on OOP principle
- PLAN: To do the Forwarding and Polymorphism Practical
- EVIDENCE: [OOP Relationships practical]

### Weekly Reflection

What went well?

- The use of doubles and mocking in testing was much clearer this week after the workshop
- The interaction of classes (and breaking one class into two classes) is feeling much more comfortable
- Pair programming

What is there to improve on?

- Giving time to self-directed learning and to afternoon challenge
- Understanding of OOPs - polymorphism
