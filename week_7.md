# Week 7: 12/04/2021

Second week of group work with project: [Notes app](AT THE END OF WEEK FORK REPO TO MY PAGE PUT LINK HERE)

### Weekly Goals

#### Goals

1. Build a frontend single-page app using only pure Javascript.
2. Request and use data from an external API.
3. Explain that libraries are made of ordinary code that I could write myself if I needed to.

#### How will I achieve these goals? (include resources and strategies)

1. Work in a team on the afternoon challenge to create a notes app in vanilla javascript on a single page
2. The afternoon challenge will include an external [emoji API](https://makers-emojify.herokuapp.com/) and use this Makers [explainer](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/calling_apis_in_javascript.md)
3. Notes app challenge will not include any ext libraries, including a testing framework, we will extract a testing framework

#### What is the evidence I have achieved the goals?
