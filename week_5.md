# Week 5: 29/03/2021

First team project at Makers: [MakersBnB](https://github.com/fg24davies/Makersbnb)

This week was organised slightly differently. We had a 4-day week to build a WebApp based on AirBnB.
I was part of a team of 4 students from my cohort.

The focus of the week was to follow the developer work flow process. The weekly goals were as follows:

### Weekly Goals

- Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs :dancer:
- Build to a specificiation (rather than challenges) :dancer:
- Run stand-ups and retrospectives :confused:
- Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow :dancer:
- Give and receive meaningful code review :dancer:

#### How have I achieved these goals?

- We spent the first day planning our MVP in detail. We used a Trello board to organise our tickets and designate pairs to work on them.
- From the specification, we took a few key points that we thought would make our MVP and broke those down into very simple User Stories to then
create tickets from 
- We carried out morning standups, lunchtime progress checkins and end-of-day retros, to share what we'd done in the day.
- As Git workflow was new for everyone we came together at the retros to merge our work together, post a code review, so we could all see the processs and learn together.
- I code reviewed another students weekend challenge and each afternoon, we looked over the pairs work to review the code. We found an important bug this way which was really helpful. 

Please go to the [MakersBnB](https://github.com/fg24davies/Makersbnb) for more detail, where the project process is in the README.md

### Weekly Reflection

- What went well? 

I felt like I learnt alot during this week about real-world and team development. I enjoyed starting from a specification and spending time planning and breaking
the project down into very small and therefore simple parts.

- What can I improve on?

In the next team project, I would like to focus more on team roles and switching roles to have a good understanding and practice of all parts of a development team
