# Week 1: 01/03/2021

### Weekly Goals
#### Goals

1. Practise basic TDD on simple programs
2. Pair using the driver-navigator style and develop best practise
3. Build and follow an effective debugging process to debug basic code 
4. Describe basic Object-Oriented principles: Encapsulation and SRP

#### How will I achieve these goals? (include resources and strategies)
1. Attend the TDD workshop and complet the weekly challenges: Boris Bikes
2. Pairprogram every afternoon with a different member of the cohort, include a 10minute feedback chat to reflect
3. Attend debugging skills workshop, use the debugging practicals
4. Use the resources in skills and workshop to

#### What is the evidence I have achieved the goals?
1. Boris Bike Challenge repository here.
2. Pair-programming reflections are included in my daily reflections below
3. I know that follow the process of Tightening the Loop (where I find the exact line of code that is causing the problem), Get visibility (use printing to understand what each variable/object is) and then attempt to change **one thing**.
4. Discussions with my pair partner before we started on our learning from this morning

#### How have I validated this?
1.
2.
3 
4. 
Validate: How will you know how well you did?

### Daily Reflection

**Tuesday 02/03/2021

- have a clearer understanding of how I will record my learning/evidence my goals

  Try to be more even with timing and switching of roles.
