# Week 1: 01/03/2021

### Weekly Goals
#### Goals

1. Practise basic TDD on simple programs
2. Pair using the driver-navigator style and develop best practise
3. Build and follow an effective debugging process to debug basic code 
4. Describe basic Object-Oriented principles: Encapsulation and SRP

#### How will I achieve these goals? (include resources and strategies)
1. Attend the TDD workshop and complet the weekly challenges: Boris Bikes
2. Pairprogram every afternoon with a different member of the cohort, include a 10minute feedback chat to reflect
3. Attend debugging skills workshop, use the debugging practicals
4. Use the resources in skills and workshop to

#### What is the evidence I have achieved the goals?
1. Boris Bike Challenge repository here.
2. Pair-programming reflections are included in my daily reflections below
3. Completed the Debugging exercises on FizzBuzz and the Cipher. I know that follow the process of Tightening the Loop (where I find the exact line of code that is causing the problem), Get visibility (use printing to understand what each variable/object is) and then attempt to change **one thing**.
4. Discussions with my pair partner before we start on our learning from this morning

### Daily Goals
Monday 01/03/2021
- Intro to Makers Day

Tuesday 02/03/2021
- AIM: Be able to write a couple of concise sentences on Encapsulation
- PLAN: Complete Practicals on encapsulation 
- EVIDENCE: Ex 1 - 3 in Encapsulation practical. Discussed with my pair partner our understanding of encapsulation.

Wednesday 03/03/2021
- AIM: To be able to debug some code
- PLAN: Attend the debugging workshop and work through debugging exercises
- EVIDENCE: Finished both the fizzbuzz and cipher exercises on debugging (ADD LINKS)

Thursday 04/03/2021
- AIM: Practise and develop TDD
- PLAN: Attend the TDD workshop, complete the TDD for the dice exercise, continue with boris bike challenge
- EVIDENCE: Boris Bike challenge with RSpec tests

Friday 05/03/2021
- AIM: Continue to develop TDD and best practice pair-programming
- PLAN: Get feedback from my partner on pair programming 

### Weekly Reflection

What went well?
- I now have a clearer understanding of how I will record my learning/evidence my goals which should improve time management next week
- I enjoyed pair programming with 3 different partners and will take feedback and the new processes I learnt into next week.
- Debugging is becoming alot faster - understanding the process of tightening the loop (identifying the line of code), getting visibility by printing alot and then only trying to fix that one thing.

What is there to improve on?
- Being more vocal in the driver seat of pair programming
- Make sure to agree with my pairing partner how frequently we'd switch between driver/navigator, to avoid unequal pairing
- Becoming more comfortable with breaking down User Stories to aid TDD.
