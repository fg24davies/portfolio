# Week 3: 15/03/2021

### Weekly Goals
#### Goals

1. Build a simple web app :dancer:
2. Follow an effective debugging process for web applications :dancer:
3. Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS) :dancer:
4. Explain the MVC pattern :dancer:

#### How will I achieve these goals? (include resources and strategies)
1. The afternoon challenge Battles and weekend challenge
2. Attend the skills workshop on debugging and use the resources given there
3. Attend the skills workshop 'How the web works' and complete practicals
4. My own research into the MVC pattern, using google and creating notes

#### What is the evidence I have achieved the goals?
1. [Battles Repo](https://github.com/fg24davies/battles_challenge)
2. Successfully [debugged the web app](https://github.com/fg24davies/makers_learning_journey/tree/master/week_3/debugging_2) in the debugging skills workshop to have passing tests and functioning web app 
3. [Process modelling of request/response](https://github.com/fg24davies/makers_learning_journey/blob/master/week_3/how_the_web_works/process_modelling.md)
4. I found that the best way to understand the MVC was through the building of the [Battle](https://github.com/fg24davies/battles_challenge) and [RPS](https://github.com/fg24davies/rps-challenge) apps

### Weekly Reflection

What went well?
The understanding of how the web works, what get and post are, the MVC pattern of a web app.
I also feel more confident in looking at errors and following my debugging process.

What can I improve on?
I think there are still gaps in my week 1 and 2 knowledge. I need to improve on SRP, DRYing my code and making sure that my logic stays in my Model level rather than controller.
RSpec mocking could be improved as well.
